  return `<p>If you know or follow me, you may already know that I deleted my Facebook account several years ago, in late 2014.</p>
<p>There were plenty of reasons for that decision, but to summarize: even back then, I couldn\u2019t reconcile my values with my continued participation in the platform. I felt that I could not be the person I wanted to be while continuing to look away from Facebook\u2019s increasing toxicity and destructiveness (even before 2016).</p>
<p>For whatever reason, I kept my Instagram account alive at the time, despite its connection to Facebook. And I\u2019m not really sure why.</p>
<p>I guess I thought Instagram was better; one of the things I hated about Facebook was its polarizing effect on people, and the indifference it showed toward ignorance and misinformation (not to mention its own role in spreading them). I think I rationalized that Instagram was more passive and friendly in comparison, less divisive. In fairness, maybe it was more so back then. Or, maybe I just didn\u2019t notice it.</p>
<p>I also tended to use Instagram a lot less. It was just a place where I occasionally posted a picture of my dog (or later, my son). I was always surprised at the end of each year that I actually <em>had</em> nine posts to make the signature 3 \xD7 3 \u201Ctop nine\u201D grid out of.</p>
<p>But lately, I\u2019ve been wondering whether I can actually continue supporting Instagram and the company behind it, however passively or at whatever seemingly insignificant scale. And while I was zeroing in on this answer anyway, the events of the last couple of weeks have clearly cemented in my mind that the answer\u2014for me, at least\u2014is an unequivocal \u201Cno.\u201D</p>

<p>It\u2019s not hard to make an argument against Instagram. There are so many valid reasons one might choose to abandon the platform that I don\u2019t feel I need to do more than mention so-called \u201Cinfluencers,\u201D or to cite the numerous studies which have linked Instagram usage to anxiety, depression, loneliness, insomnia, body image issues and bullying (particularly for teenage girls).</p>
<p>Instead of speaking in such sweeping terms, I\u2019d like to focus in just a bit more.</p>

<p>In this moment\u2014Blackout Tuesday, as it\u2019s being called by many (for better or worse, given its dubious origins and ill effects on the critical #BlackLivesMatter hashtag feed)\u2014it\u2019s become clearer than ever that Facebook does not now, nor will it ever take responsibility for its ongoing, deliberate, and destructive impact on the world in general, and the US in particular.</p>

<p>This is where I\u2019ll be conflating Facebook and Instagram a bit, but that\u2019s on purpose. It\u2019s clear that the two are intrinsically the same company as far as this topic goes. Marvel might be technically different than Disney, but the dollars go the same place.</p>
<hr>
<p>Before this year, Facebook\u2014specifically, Mark Zuckerberg himself\u2014pledged that the company would take a stand against unethical misuse of its platform, in light of the role Facebook played in Russia\u2019s campaign of misinformation during the 2016 election. It is only right, after all, that a platform vulnerable to such abuse takes any and all precautions to patch that vulnerability. I work at a software company; I regularly see exploits exponentially smaller than that still taken with grave sobriety.</p>
<p>But since then, and particularly with the events of the past week, Facebook\u2019s promise of accountability and oversight have been more than walked back as the company has instead doubled down on its role in spreading hate, racism, and lies.</p>
${(0, import_index_2749e1b7.v)(import_PullQuote_effacfdf.P, "PullQuote").$$render($$result, {}, {}, {
    default: () => {
      return `Misinformation is not benign; it always benefits those with the power to spread it, at the cost of those without the voice to fight\xA0it.
`;
    }
  })}
<p>Among other things: Zuckerberg has gone on the record numerous times now to claim that fact-checking politicians is not in the platform\u2019s interest (effectively defending their right to spread misinformation at whatever cost and with any reason). On the surface, this may sound like a defense of first amendment rights, but misinformation is not benign; it always benefits those with the voice to spread it, at the cost of those without the voice to fight it.</p>
<p>It\u2019s critical to keep context in mind when discussing the \u201Cright\u201D to misinform at grand scale and with impunity. This type of distortion is almost always used for, and is most effective at, spreading hatred, in a way that neither further falsehoods nor the truth are entirely adequate to fight (as you know if you\u2019ve ever tried to correct a family member who shared something inaccurate or false).</p>
<p>Misinformation is not a two-way street, and it is not to be treated as mere opinion. To side with the right to spread falsehood unchecked is to side with racism, bigotry, anti-science, and any other cause benefited by a lack of context and truth.</p>
<p>Zuckerberg has also refused to acknowledge that the president threatening violent military action against US citizens\u2014let alone citizens who are exercising their constitutional right to protest\u2014is problematic, or to do almost anything about all but the most blatantly violent, racist, hateful or even outright fake posts from just about any source, let alone those in power.</p>

`;
    }
  })}
<p>Time and again, Facebook\u2019s leadership has failed to demonstrate any substantial interest whatsoever in ensuring their platform is not used for malicious intent.</p>
<p>In short, Facebook has failed us\u2014as users, as citizens, and as humans\u2014to an extent that I feel demands I can no longer be even tangentially complicit in anything the company does.</p>
<p>It shouldn\u2019t have taken this long, for any and all of the reasons above. Facebook is, quite frankly, an awful company (and again: it was long before 2016, lest I give the impression this is just about recent events or the election).</p>

    }

<p>But it\u2019s become clear in recent years that not only will Facebook move in the opposite direction of positive change, but that the company\u2019s role in supporting hate, malice and ignorance is not even a passive one; regardless of the intention or motivation, the outcome is the same. Facebook has positioned itself, actively and deliberately, to be a key player in enabling fascism.</p>
<p>(If that word feels a little strong to you\u2026well, give it time.)</p>
<h2 id="${"what-does-this-do"}"><a aria-hidden="${"true"}" tabindex="${"-1"}" href="${"#what-does-this-do"}"><span class="${"icon icon-link"}"></span></a>What does this do?</h2>
<p>Even given the above, I still honestly grapple with whether leaving is the right thing to do.</p>
<p>Me giving up Instagram isn\u2019t particularly courageous or noble or impactful. It\u2019s pretty much <em>nothing</em>. It was never that important to me to begin with, but regardless, my participation (or lack thereof) has effectively zero effect on either Facebook or the world.</p>
<p>Leaving is so seemingly meaningless it appears pointless. Despite the prevalence of ads (<em>SO MANY ADS</em>) on Instagram\u2014which must be presumably assigning <em>some</em> small monetary value to my attention\u2014I\u2019m an all-but-undetectable speck in the galaxy of its users. So why leave? Why <em>not</em> stay if it doesn\u2019t matter?</p>
<p>Because ethics, I believe, aren\u2019t about scale.</p>
<p>I barely knew my maternal grandmother, but I\u2019m told that she had a saying on ethics, which I\u2019m paraphrasing here as: \u201Cif you\u2019re unsure whether something is right or wrong, magnify it by 100 times.\u201D</p>
<p>She reasoned that, if stealing something seems harmless, what if you stole a hundred times? If you could justify a violent word or action, could you really justify 100?</p>
<p>And conversely: if giving what you have seems meaningless, what if you had 100 times that to give?</p>
${(0, import_index_2749e1b7.v)(import_PullQuote_effacfdf.P, "PullQuote").$$render($$result, {}, {}, {
    default: () => {
      return `This isn\u2019t me filling the offering plate, or acting like I can; this is me giving my\xA0dollar.
`;
    }
  })}
<p>Me removing myself from Facebook\u2019s platforms won\u2019t mean anything on its own. But for me, it\u2019s not really <em>supposed</em> to.</p>
<p>This is me, reconciling my beliefs with my actions, and choosing not to look the other way any more, no matter how many other pairs of eyes might be pointed in that direction.</p>
<p>This isn\u2019t me filling the offering plate, or acting like I can; this is me giving my dollar.</p>
<p>I won\u2019t tell you whether Instagram\u2014or even Facebook, for that matter\u2014is good for you, or whether you should quit. I understand they\u2019re both tools for community, and that they both serve positive causes as well as negative. Maybe you feel you can, or do, offset the inherent negativity of the platform with the impact of your usage.</p>
<p>Obviously, there are millions of users of Instagram using the platform to support Black Lives Matter, Pride Month, and other very good and noble causes. I\u2019m fully in support of that, unequivocally. But for me, personally: if I\u2019m not using Instagram regularly to begin with, does me hopping on just to post a black square or a rainbow avatar actually help? If I\u2019m showing up for the big things and not participating in the little things, is my impact actually positive, or am I no better than the influencers artificially manufacturing Black Lives Matter photo ops without actually contributing anything substantial?</p>
<p>My feelings on the matter are further complicated by the fact that: if I\u2019m being honest, one major catalyst of these beliefs was, ironically, Facebook.</p>
<p>I have Facebook itself to thank for a good deal of the progress I myself made as a person in my 20s and early 30s, as friends and acquaintances on the platform (especially women) helped to gradually push me to become aware of my own bias and privilege (having been blinded to them by, among other things, the religious conservative values I had been brought up with to that point). Frankly, much as it pains me to admit it, Facebook itself is a large part of the reason I have the beliefs I do today.</p>
${(0, import_index_2749e1b7.v)(import_PullQuote_effacfdf.P, "PullQuote").$$render($$result, {}, {}, {
    default: () => {
      return `I don\u2019t believe Instagram puts enough good in my life\u2014or that I put enough good into the world because of it\u2014to justify my continued\xA0usage.
`;
    }
  })}
<p>That said, though, it could have just as easily gone the opposite way, and Facebook could have further galvanized my then-problematic views, a fact which had the odd effect of making it both easier and harder to leave.</p>
<p>Partly because of this, I\u2019ve also wrestled with the idea of abandonment. By leaving the platform, am I abdicating my responsibility to use it to speak out against those misusing it? Am I creating a void that will be filled by more misinformation and hatred? What if <em>everyone</em> who felt like I did left? Sure, it would hurt the company, but would it do more harm than good to create an open forum for racists and bigots to share content freely?</p>
<p>All of this is to say nothing of the fact that I have something of a luxury in being able to just walk away from Instagram with virtually no impact to myself in the first place. Plenty of people run businesses that rely at least partially on Instagram. What about the revenue and/or attention they rely on from the platform?</p>
<p>These are hard questions, and I admit I don\u2019t have good answers to them. So\u2026your mileage may vary, I suppose. What you feel is right for you may be different than what I feel, and as long as these questions and their impact are at least being honestly considered, I\u2019m all right with that.</p>
<p>But for me, right now, it\u2019s become clear that the ethics of the company behind Instagram are antithetical to what I believe is right on any scale. I don\u2019t believe Instagram puts enough good in my life\u2014or that I put enough good into the world because of it\u2014to justify my continued usage.</p>
<p>No matter how tiny a grain of sand I might be in that sandcastle, I can\u2019t in good conscience be a part of its walls any more.</p>
${(0, import_index_2749e1b7.v)(import_PullQuote_effacfdf.P, "PullQuote").$$render($$result, {}, {}, {

<p>If you\u2019d like to keep in touch with me, I\u2019ll still be around on <a href="${"https://twitter.com/rickyjanuari"}" rel="${"nofollow"}">Twitter</a>, at least until I face the same reckoning there (though my content there is of a decidedly different flavor). And I\u2019ll be attempting to add some more personal content both there and here, on my personal site.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I wish you all well, and hope\u2014regardless of the answer\u2014that you\u2019ll at least spend some time considering our role in supporting social media platforms, Facebook and Instagram in particular. Thank you for taking the time to read my thoughts on the topic.</p>`;
