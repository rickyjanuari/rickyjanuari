  return `<p>Working at a branding agency, you frequently find yourself in preliminary meetings where people describe their organization to you. \u201CWhat makes you different?\u201D is the question at the heart of branding and marketing. And whether the organization in question is a nonprofit, a Fortune 500 company or a local startup, the people at the head of it always have very specific ideas about what makes their particular outfit different from any other.</p>
<p>(Whether these ideas are original is another matter\u2014\u201CIntegrity\u201D is such a\xA0popular word in these conversations that it\u2019s immediately\xA0rejected as soon as it\u2019s spoken. Phrases like \u201Cwe put service first,\u201D or \u201Cwe have a commitment to excellence\u201D are so similarly generic as to be rendered meaningless by their ubiquity. What organization <em>wouldn\u2019t</em> say those things?)</p>
<p>But that\u2019s ok; we as designers, branding agencies, etc. wouldn\u2019t have jobs if everybody already knew all about the unique strengths and weaknesses of their own brand and how to ideally leverage those qualities. We\u2019re here because clients need an outside, more objective point of view; an expert.</p>

<p>One of the things I love about where I work and the process we employ is that\xA0these conversations\xA0are not by far the end of our discovery\u2014nor should they\xA0be for any agency that takes branding seriously. <a href="${"http://dday.com"}" rel="${"nofollow"}">David Day | Associates</a>\u2019\xA0brand process (at the risk of sounding like too much of a company man) can often take weeks or even months of intensive research, interviews, surveys, workshops, roundtables and market exploration. All of this takes place at every level; stakeholder, consumer, competitor, market peers and those completely outside the brand\u2019s hemisphere.</p>
<p>This practice certainly isn\u2019t unique to dda (though most branding agencies have\xA0honed and personalized their\xA0approach to it, ours\xA0included), but the goal and result of this is the distillation\xA0of\xA0<em>brand values:</em>\xA0a collection of words or phrases painstakingly extracted from this process which form\xA0the central brand identity. These values are a mantra of sorts, a kind of brand code, refining and solidly defining\xA0why the\xA0organization\xA0exists, how it does everything it does and will go about\xA0operating in the future. Some companies (and the agencies that brand them) have other names for the brand values, but the meaning is the same, and virtually every company on the planet\u2014especially the larger and more successful ones\u2014have and embrace them.</p>
<p>If done well and researched carefully, the words and phrases that emerge from the branding process form a cohesive identity. These values will be personal, meaningful and unique.</p>
<p>For example, below are the ten core values of <a href="${"http://www.zappos.com/"}" rel="${"nofollow"}">Zappos</a>:</p>
<ol><li>Deliver WOW Through Service</li>
<li>Embrace and Drive Change</li>
<li>Create Fun and A Little Weirdness</li>
<li>Be Adventurous, Creative, and Open-Minded</li>
<li>Pursue Growth and Learning</li>
<li>Build Open and Honest Relationships With Communication</li>
<li>Build a Positive Team and Family Spirit</li>
<li>Do More With Less</li>
<li>Be Passionate and Determined</li>
<li>Be Humble</li></ol>
<p>That\u2019s great, isn\u2019t it? That list <em>sounds</em> like Zappos. It <em>feels</em> like their brand feels. You get a sense of what that organization is all about and even what their workplace culture might be like just\xA0from that tiny list. And that\u2019s the whole point; this is the beating heart of the brand.</p>
<p>It\u2019s not uncommon for executives to commission\xA0posters, mugs and mousepads with the brand\xA0values on them. In the offices of a company that\u2019s been through this process, ideally, everybody from the CEO on down makes their business decisions based on their alignment with these values, HR rewards employees for exhibiting these values in their everyday work, and the success of the company and its employees is measured solely against them.</p>
<p><em>Deep breath.</em></p>
<p>But\u2026that\u2019s not often the case, is it?</p>
<h2 id="${"where-brands-fall-apart"}"><a aria-hidden="${"true"}" tabindex="${"-1"}" href="${"#where-brands-fall-apart"}"><span class="${"icon icon-link"}"></span></a>Where Brands Fall Apart</h2>
<p>Here\u2019s where I\u2019m going with this: that company I just described doesn\u2019t really seem to exist in reality most of the time, does it? Which begs the question:</p>
<p><em>If this sort of holistic\xA0dedication\xA0to brand values is\xA0so common in theory, why is it so rare in practice?</em></p>
<p>Just as any\xA0executive or business owner will\xA0<em>say</em>\xA0their company values integrity (and quality and service, of course), so virtually every company\xA0<em>claims</em> that they reward and value their employees exhibiting their brand values.</p>
<p>But is that really accurate?</p>
${(0, import_index_2749e1b7.v)(import_PullQuote_effacfdf.P, "PullQuote").$$render($$result, {}, {}, {
    default: () => {
      return `If this sort of holistic dedication to brand values is so common in theory, why is it so rare in practice?

<p>I\u2019ve heard of a lot of CEOs being fired for failing to turn a profit, just as I\u2019m sure you have. There are countless examples of the exit door swinging open rapidly\xA0for executives who dropped shareholder prices or who initiated plans, programs and products that weren\u2019t sufficiently fiscally successful.\xA0If you want to lose your job, there\u2019s no surer way than to lose your\xA0company some money.</p>
<p>So where are all of the CEOs, executives and managers who lost their jobs for failing to adequately exhibit and execute the brand\u2019s core values?</p>
<p>To take the example above, if you work at Zappos, hopefully somebody will take notice if you\u2019re not pursuing growth and learning (#5), or if you are not helping to build a positive team and family spirit (#7). But whether or not that happens in reality (and I can\u2019t speak to that particular company\u2019s culture either way), I feel confident they\u2019ll notice and respond quickly if you\u2019re costing the company money.</p>
<p>Sure, the point of business is to make money, but if these brand\xA0values are really supposed to inform everything that a company\xA0does, shouldn\u2019t the question at least be asked occasionally:\xA0<em>does profit ever conflict with our\xA0values</em>? What if the employee or manager who\u2019s losing the money is doing so in the name of upholding the brand values?</p>
${(0, import_index_2749e1b7.v)(import_PullQuote_effacfdf.P, "PullQuote").$$render($$result, {}, {}, {
    default: () => {
      return `Sure, the point of business is to make money, but if these brand values are really supposed to inform everything that a company does, shouldn\u2019t the question at least be asked occasionally: does profit ever conflict with our values?

<p>There are many instances where this exact thing does happen; we just don\u2019t tend to think of it in this light. For example: a business that says it puts people first will lay off workers in a location that isn\u2019t sufficiently profitable even when there were other options available; a company that claims to value family above all else will either pay its employees too little to afford child care or demand too many hours to make raising children viable; a company that says it values innovation will try to guard its own research from other innovators for fear of losing dollars; and a business that supposedly takes pride in its country, state and local community will move offshore to avoid taxes. Hell, I\u2019ve even heard people in healthcare argue against treating patients in desperate need if they can\u2019t pay.</p>
<p>All of this is invariably done for one central, core, defining purpose: profit.\xA0It\u2019s the first option in the flowchart of modern capitalism:\xA0</p>
<p><em>Can you make money?</em>\xA0&gt; Yes &gt; <em>Make money.</em> [End of chart]</p>
<p>So this leaves us in the position of accepting one of two uncomfortable realities:</p>
<ol><li>Companies lie about their values;</li>
<li>Companies tell the truth about their values, but profit is also one, and it\xA0trumps the rest.</li></ol>
<p>In either of the similar realities\xA0above, we\u2019re forced to ask what purpose and\xA0legitimacy these brand values actually hold. It\u2019s almost insultingly\xA0easy to find a product or service advertising something like, \u201CWe put quality and integrity at the heart of all we do.\u201D And we buy it (figuratively and literally). But if that exact same product or service said \u201CWe put profit at the heart of all we do,\u201D we\u2019d flip it the bird and walk away\u2014even though we all know deep down that if every company were being honest, almost every\xA0piece of corporate business communication\xA0would say this.</p>
<p>This is a problem. How do we change this behavior?</p>
<p>As always, it\u2019s up to you, consumer. Vote with your dollars. It\u2019s time to reward companies that truly live out their brand values and put those before their own profit margins.</p>
<p>It\u2019s up to you,\xA0employees, to raise your voice and blow the proverbial whistle when you see companies contradicting their own values.</p>
<p>And it\u2019s up to you,\xA0bosses, managers, presidents and CEOs,\xA0to put the health of your brand ahead of the health of your shareholders\u2019 wallets. Money\u2019s nice, but it\u2019s nothing more than a means to an end. And if you\u2019re sacrificing good people on the way to that end, then it isn\u2019t worth it.</p>
<p>The best way to improve your product,\xA0service,\xA0or whatever it is that your organization offers is to invest in the people creating it. And\xA0<em>that</em> is often completely counterintuitive to investing in profit.</p>
<p>Profit is not a value.</p>
<p>It\u2019s up to all of us to stop acting like it is.</p>`;
