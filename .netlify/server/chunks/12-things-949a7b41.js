<p>As many of you may know, I recently took on the self-appointed challenge of staying off Facebook for 60 days. \u2026Well, actually, that\u2019s only partly true; I initially gave up Facebook for an indefinite amount of time. When I made the decision, part of me hoped that maybe it would result in a permanent termination.</p>
<p>But 60 days was all I lasted.</p>
<p>So was I an addict who couldn\u2019t go more than a couple months without a fix? Or was Facebook actually valuable enough to make me reconsider?</p>
<p><strong>To be honest\u2026a little of both.</strong></p>
<p>Below are the realizations I had from approximately January 1 to March 1, 2015.</p>
<h2 id="${"1-facebook-trains-you-to-not-read-things"}"><a aria-hidden="${"true"}" tabindex="${"-1"}" href="${"#1-facebook-trains-you-to-not-read-things"}"><span class="${"icon icon-link"}"></span></a>#1. Facebook trains you to not read things</h2>

`;
    }
  })}
<p>You\u2019re not going to read this whole post. If anything, you\u2019re just going to skim the headlines to see if any of it looks interesting. That\u2019s ok; that\u2019s what I do, too. The internet in general and social media in particular have trained us not so much to read, but to search for what we find interesting. To the human eye, that naturally is not text. But it wasn\u2019t until I\u2019d gotten back on Facebook that I realized how much text was flying through my field of vision with less than a second\u2019s thought\u2026or wondered what I was looking for.</p>

<p>I didn\u2019t even write this to be a numbered list originally. I just realized at some point in late January how long it had been since I\u2019d seen an article with a number beginning its title and wondered: why are we attracted to this type of post?</p>
<p>I don\u2019t know, but if you\u2019re already bored, or if you\u2019re used to being directed to a specific number, I think #10 is probably the most important.</p>

`;
    }
  })}
<p>This one was the most surprising to me. Just try it. You will disappear off your friends\u2019 invite radar once you leave Facebook. Somehow, for better or worse, it\u2019s become the de facto vehicle for invitations of virtually every type, and nobody except maybe your mom will bother to actually contact you directly if you don\u2019t respond. Unless it\u2019s too small to actually plan or large enough to sell tickets, Facebook is the only way you\u2019re hearing about it.</p>

<p>As part of this exercise, I uninstalled the Facebook app from my phone. </p>
<p>I was astounded how many times my thumb would automatically, without so much as a conscious thought, move to the space where the Facebook app icon used to be. It would happen dozens of times a day.</p>
<p>I actually found myself wondering\u2014and I\u2019m ashamed to admit this\u2014\u201Cwhat did I do while I was in the bathroom before I got a smartphone?\u201D (Don\u2019t picture that.)</p>

`;
    }
  })}
<p>Once I was off social media, I started noticing how often the people around me\u2014often people close to me, with whom I was having some sort of social interaction (however minor)\u2014whipped out their smartphones to stare at a feed through which they endlessly scrolled.</p>
<p>I don\u2019t begrudge them; I get it. I\u2019ve done the same thing unconsciously, compulsively, a thousand times. I can\u2019t tell you how many times I\u2019ve wondered why I\u2019m even still scrolling. <strong>I\u2019m more cognizant of that now; the break made me realize that most of the time when I\u2019m browsing my feed, it\u2019s as a junkie looking desperately for his next fix.</strong></p>
<h2 id="${"5-i-was-a-like-addict"}"><a aria-hidden="${"true"}" tabindex="${"-1"}" href="${"#5-i-was-a-like-addict"}"><span class="${"icon icon-link"}"></span></a>#5. I was a \u201Clike\u201D addict</h2>
<p>And maybe I still am.</p>
<p>Maybe you can relate, or maybe it\u2019s just my addictive and feedback-driven personality, but I realized I was <em>always</em> posting things with whether they would get a click in mind. When I gave up Facebook, I still held on to Twitter and found it frustrating that I would post things that didn\u2019t get responses.</p>
<p>It\u2019s one thing to like the feeling of connectedness that Facebook might bring, or to use it as a form of entertainment or escapism. But to be using it for <em>personal validation</em>? \u2026That\u2019s kind of messed up. But I guess the first step is admitting you have a problem, right?</p>
<h2 id="${"6-the-politics-on-facebook-affect-you-a-lot-more-than-you-think-they-do"}"><a aria-hidden="${"true"}" tabindex="${"-1"}" href="${"#6-the-politics-on-facebook-affect-you-a-lot-more-than-you-think-they-do"}"><span class="${"icon icon-link"}"></span></a>#6. The politics on Facebook affect you a lot more than you think they do</h2>
<p>Even the political posts I happened to agree with, I realized in their absence, often had a negative effect on my mental and emotional state. This is largely due, no doubt, to the fact that most politically relevant posts on social media are specifically designed to be polarizing. No matter how much you agree or disagree with [insert political voice here], that voice needs you to take action. Those posts need you to react, to feel something. Whether it\u2019s angry, sad, shocked, enraged, despondent, whatever\u2014<strong>political posts are <em>literally</em> hurting you</strong>. They\u2019re ruining your emotional state and they\u2019re driving you to further political extremes.</p>
<p><strong>ALL of the politics on Facebook\u2014including and maybe even especially those that I agreed with\u2014are the part I missed the least.</strong> It was peaceful outside their storm.</p>
<p>When I started using Facebook again, the pages I stopped following weren\u2019t ones that made me angry in disagreement; they were the ones closest to my views. Those views haven\u2019t changed, but I really don\u2019t feel the need to get worked up about them every day of my life.</p>
<h2 id="${"7-the-login-with-facebook-button-is-soooo-convenient"}"><a aria-hidden="${"true"}" tabindex="${"-1"}" href="${"#7-the-login-with-facebook-button-is-soooo-convenient"}"><span class="${"icon icon-link"}"></span></a>#7. The \u201CLogin with Facebook\u201D button is soooo convenient</h2>
<p>Try locking yourself out of Facebook on all your devices and see how many new apps and websites suddenly become completely unworthy of the trouble to create an account or login.</p>
<h2 id="${"8-i-have-social-media-only-friends-and-i-missed-them"}"><a aria-hidden="${"true"}" tabindex="${"-1"}" href="${"#8-i-have-social-media-only-friends-and-i-missed-them"}"><span class="${"icon icon-link"}"></span></a>#8. I have social media-only friends (and I missed them)</h2>
<p>I never realized it before the break, but a unique class of friend had emerged for me on Facebook.</p>
<p>Somewhere amid the sea of digital friends that I see or call or speak to exactly zero times a year, a little island with some happy, digital-only buddies had cropped up. I didn\u2019t miss family or local friends when I quit social media, because I still had contact with them. But <strong>I did actually miss some of the people with whom I regularly interacted on Facebook</strong>, people I rarely or never see in real life, but whose online relationship, I was somewhat surprised to learn, had grown meaningful to me.</p>
<h2 id="${"9-smartphones-are-killing-our-necks"}"><a aria-hidden="${"true"}" tabindex="${"-1"}" href="${"#9-smartphones-are-killing-our-necks"}"><span class="${"icon icon-link"}"></span></a>#9. Smartphones are killing our necks</h2>
<p>Seriously; I never realized how much neck stiffness I had until I stopped checking for updates every two minutes.</p>
<h2 id="${"10-connectedness-is-costing-us"}"><a aria-hidden="${"true"}" tabindex="${"-1"}" href="${"#10-connectedness-is-costing-us"}"><span class="${"icon icon-link"}"></span></a>#10. Connectedness is costing us</h2>
<p>Or put another way: </p>
<p>I\u2019m beginning to believe that becoming more connected with everyone is making me less connected with anyone.</p>
<p>All that time spent browsing, reading, liking\u2026it has to come from somewhere. Any minute you are or could be in the presence of another human being spent on social media is a minute you\u2019re taking from them and splitting up a dozen, a hundred, or a thousand ways. It\u2019s significantly weakening one good relationship in the name of very slightly strengthening many others.</p>
${(0, import_index_2749e1b7.v)(import_PullQuote_effacfdf.P, "PullQuote").$$render($$result, {}, {}, {
    default: () => {
      return `I&#39;m beginning to believe that becoming more connected with everyone is making me less connected with\xA0anyone.
`;
    }
  })}
<p>Maybe this is a negative view of the situation, or maybe it\u2019s a bit extreme. Maybe time and relationships aren\u2019t a zero-sum game. But let me ask you a question:</p>
<p>When you\u2019re sitting on the couch or lying in bed, what do you spend more time looking at and interacting with: your phone and the people with whom it connects you\u2026or the person next to you?</p>
<h2 id="${"11-facebook-is-more-of-a-communication-tool-than-you-think"}"><a aria-hidden="${"true"}" tabindex="${"-1"}" href="${"#11-facebook-is-more-of-a-communication-tool-than-you-think"}"><span class="${"icon icon-link"}"></span></a>#11. Facebook is more of a communication tool than you think</h2>
<p>I never realized how many people fit into the category of \u201D<em>good enough friends that I occasionally need to send them some kind of message directly, but not such good friends that it\u2019s easy for us to call or text each other</em>\u201D until Facebook Messenger was no longer an option. I also didn\u2019t realize how many people would completely drop out of my life, most likely never to be seen or heard from again, if I truly cut Facebook out of it.</p>
<h2 id="${"12-facebook-isnt-meaningless"}"><a aria-hidden="${"true"}" tabindex="${"-1"}" href="${"#12-facebook-isnt-meaningless"}"><span class="${"icon icon-link"}"></span></a>#12. Facebook isn\u2019t meaningless</h2>
<p>I almost hate to say it, because like I said at the beginning of all this, I sorta hoped that this break would result in a break-up. But it didn\u2019t. It left me right back where I was, because <strong>I realized that for all of Facebook\u2019s myriad flaws, and for its enervating tendency to exacerbate my own shortcomings, it still has value.</strong></p>
<p>I\u2019m back on now because of that. It\u2019s a valuable networking tool and at least a partially meaningful method of interpersonal communication. I\u2019m at a point in life right now where that makes Facebook important enough to keep it around, at least for now.</p>
<p>I\u2019m trying not to check it as much, not to think about it as much. I\u2019m trying to do the slightly more difficult thing and speak to the people in front of me instead of wondering what distraction the device in my pocket might provide. I\u2019m trying, in short, to be a better person, and to not let the promise of blissful digital engagement affect my thought patterns or my mental state as much.</p>
<p>A break from Facebook was very good for me. I encourage everybody to try it, at least once, and at least for a short time.</p>
<p>Even if it\u2019s just to find out what you do without it in the bathroom.</p>`;
