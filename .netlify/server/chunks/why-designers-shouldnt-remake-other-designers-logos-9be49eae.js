<p>Earlier this week, <a href="${"http://google.com"}" rel="${"nofollow"}">Google</a> unveiled their new sans-serif identity, ditching the familiar serifs\xA0for which the company has been known since its inception for a cleaner, simpler look:</p>
<p><img src="${"/images/post_images/Screen-Shot-2015-09-03-at-9_14_54-AM.png"}" alt="${"Google's new logo on its iconic homescreen."}"></p>
<p>Among the population in general, and particularly among designers, reviews have been mixed. Some herald this as a fresh new direction, perhaps <em>the</em> emblematic tech company boldly being unafraid to leave behind the conventions of the past to embrace the present and future. Others\u2026well, others thought it might have been better.</p>
<p>That\u2019s an understatement, really. Barely 48 hours had\xA0passed since the announcement\xA0when, with\xA0a cursory search of\xA0the word \u201CGoogle\u201D in <a href="${"https://dribbble.com/"}" rel="${"nofollow"}">Dribbble</a>, I came upon pages and\xA0pages full of graphic designers posting their ideas for a \u201Cfixed\u201D or \u201Cbetter\u201D version of Google\u2019s new logo. Here\u2019s just a small glance at everything that was out there (believe me\u2014there were hundreds more, and again, this was less than two days after the new identity system was announced):</p>
<p><img src="${"/images/post_images/Screen-Shot-2015-09-03-at-9.07.07-AM.png"}" alt="${"Designers scrambling to 'fix' Google's new logo"}"></p>
<p>To say that this behavior was limited to Dribbble would be inaccurate. The announcement was made on Tuesday, and before the day was even over there were slews of articles, some thousands of words long, popping up\xA0all\xA0across the internet, many of which\xA0filled with righteous indignation over Google\u2019s decision to go with something so supposedly unoriginal, plain, radically different, or just bad (in the opinion of the writer, of course).</p>
<p>Accusations cropped up. Some said Google had copied their new logo from an old Gymboree mark (<em>as though two colorful sans-serif capital Gs ought to\xA0look unmistakably distinct</em>):</p>
<blockquote class="${"twitter-tweet"}" lang="${"en"}"><p dir="${"ltr"}" lang="${"en"}"><a href="${"https://twitter.com/Gymboree"}">@Gymboree</a> &#39;s identity (1993-2000) vs.<a href="${"https://twitter.com/google"}">@google</a>&#39;s new identity (Sep 01, 2015) <a href="${"https://twitter.com/hashtag/gymbore?src=hash"}">#gymbore</a> <a href="${"https://twitter.com/hashtag/google?src=hash"}">#google</a> <a href="${"https://twitter.com/hashtag/logo?src=hash"}">#logo</a> <a href="${"https://twitter.com/hashtag/GoogleLogo?src=hash"}">#GoogleLogo</a> <a href="${"http://t.co/uf2ucAxoS1"}">pic.twitter.com/uf2ucAxoS1</a></p>\u2014 Micael Butial (@caelerz) <a href="${"https://twitter.com/caelerz/status/638926119270400000"}">September 2, 2015</a></blockquote>
<p>Others accused Google of simple unoriginality (<em>as though a few cherry-picked modern sans-serif logotypes</em> wouldn\u2019t <em>look similar when they\u2019re all shown side-by-side in black</em>):</p>
<blockquote class="${"twitter-tweet"}" lang="${"en"}"><a href="${"https://twitter.com/hashtag/creative?src=hash"}">#creative</a> <a href="${"http://t.co/u9ScnzwCbC"}">pic.twitter.com/u9ScnzwCbC</a> \u2014 Ramin Nasibov (@RaminNasibov) <a href="${"https://twitter.com/RaminNasibov/status/639022680151355392"}">September 2, 2015</a></blockquote>
<p>While still others thought it was just plain poor, like <a href="${"http://www.businessinsider.com/typography-expert-hates-googles-new-logo-2015-9"}" rel="${"nofollow"}">this typographer</a>.</p>
<p>In the case of Google, I\u2019d like to go on a small tangent and point out that Google is really playing their own game here. In terms of identity, their needs are radically different than pretty much any other company on <del>Google</del> Earth. They don\u2019t really have competitors, at least not like most brands do. Sure, there\u2019s Apple and Microsoft, but for the most part, Google has already won every game it\u2019s\xA0playing.\xA0Google is\xA0the 800 lb. gorilla; it sits wherever it wants. It doesn\u2019t need to worry much about being confused with, or looking worse than, any another company. Short of Google changing their logo to, say, a swastika, people aren\u2019t going to stop using Google products. We\u2019re still going to use\xA0google.com for searching (which everyone\xA0will still call \u201CGoogling,\u201D even if it\u2019s not technically accurate), we\u2019ll still use our gmail accounts, we\u2019ll still look to <a href="${"https://www.google.com/maps"}" rel="${"nofollow"}">Google Maps</a> any time we need directions somewhere, and on and on. Even the least plugged-in among us probably still has\xA0their life impacted by Google a dozen times a day.</p>
${(0, import_index_2749e1b7.v)(import_PullQuote_effacfdf.P, "PullQuote").$$render($$result, {}, {}, {
    default: () => {
      return `Google&#39;s\xA0problem wasn&#39;t that they needed\xA0the greatest logo\xA0ever; their problem was that they needed a unifying identity system, and that problem has now been\xA0solved.
`;
    }
  })}
<p>So in terms of branding, Google doesn\u2019t really have to listen to anybody, least of all an upset\xA0designer on the internet.</p>
<p>But tangent aside, and not specific to Google: any time a new design comes out, there is bound to be discussion about whether or not that new design\u2014pardon the pun\u2014misses the mark. Sometimes this discussion will be heated. Sometimes it will even become such a cacophonous outcry that the brand behind the design decides it might be best to take a step back. (Gap, anyone? For the record: I don\u2019t think it was as bad as everyone else did. So the aborted logo redesign\xA0was plain. What is Gap, exactly? Gap sells\xA0khakis and business-casual button-ups.\xA0If that\u2019s not Helvetica in clothing form, I don\u2019t know what is.)</p>
<p>I\u2019m not necessarily saying Google\u2019s new logo is the greatest thing ever\xA0(though that\u2019s beside the point:\xA0Google\u2019s\xA0problem wasn\u2019t that they needed\xA0the greatest logo\xA0ever; their problem was that they needed a unifying identity system, and that problem has now been solved.) And I\u2019m not saying all the feedback that emerged from the design community was unwarranted or inaccurate. That typographer above makes some reasonable points. Many designers did.</p>
<p>But the problem was, they made these points and registered these reactions instantaneously and without regard for what makes graphic design more than subjective window dressing: the <em>how</em>\xA0and the <em>why</em>.</p>
<h2 id="${"emotion-vs-thought"}"><a aria-hidden="${"true"}" tabindex="${"-1"}" href="${"#emotion-vs-thought"}"><span class="${"icon icon-link"}"></span></a>Emotion vs. Thought</h2>
<p>Graphic design is a tricky thing. It\u2019s both art and science, subjective and objective. It\u2019s part left-brained rationality and part right-brained creativity. It\u2019s a merging of thought\xA0and emotion. And this is what makes reacting to graphic design such a careful balance of immediate reactions and delayed reactions.</p>
<p>When we present designs (and especially redesigns or entirely new names) to clients, we always tell them: register your immediate reactions, think about them and remember them. But don\u2019t put too much weight on them\xA0and don\u2019t let your immediate reaction kill an idea before it\u2019s had a chance to grow on you, because\u2014and this is important\u2014<strong>the human brain is wired to reject things it isn\u2019t accustomed to.</strong></p>
<p>You know why movie sequels are so popular? Because people want things that are new, but they don\u2019t like things that are unfamiliar. So it is with design; we <em>say</em> we want things to look fresh and new, but our brains really don\u2019t like anything we\u2019re unfamiliar or uncomfortable with. It\u2019s just part of human nature. That\u2019s why we lash out at new logos and new identities; like it or not, no matter how consciously aware we are of it, there\u2019s an animal part of our brain that screams out \u201CI don\u2019t like it!\u201D like a toddler\xA0refusing to try a new food.</p>
${(0, import_index_2749e1b7.v)(import_PullQuote_effacfdf.P, "PullQuote").$$render($$result, {}, {}, {
    default: () => {
      return `The human brain is wired to reject things it isn&#39;t accustomed to. You know why movie sequels are so popular? Because people want things that are new, but they don&#39;t like things that are\xA0unfamiliar.
`;
    }
  })}
<p>But fortunately for our primitive brains, time changes perception. We all have things we didn\u2019t like at first but grew to love as we came to understand them better. (For me, pretty much every one of my favorite albums is one that I didn\u2019t like at all on first listen, while most of the albums I loved right off the bat\xA0I now find completely uninteresting.) Every time Pepsi changes their logo it seems like a radical shift for a little while, but before long, it looks weird when you spot the last\xA0version\xA0in the background of a movie.</p>
<p>We\u2019ve all tried something we hated at first or met somebody we didn\u2019t like at first impression, only to realize over time that either we were wrong, our perceptions were wrong, or we\u2019ve actually changed.\xA0Design requires this type of delayed reaction. It requires you to live with it and get to know it on a deep level, not just a surface emotional reaction.</p>
<p>Emotion screams out at first impression. It\u2019s irrational and unhesitant, but it\u2019s fast.\xA0Thought takes time. It\u2019s careful and logical, but it doesn\u2019t happen quickly.</p>
<p>And that\u2019s one reason why you shouldn\u2019t be writing scathing blog posts about new logo designs or remaking them to \u201Cfix\u201D them within the first hours of their existence. But there\u2019s another, more important one:</p>
<h2 id="${"the-message-youre-sending"}"><a aria-hidden="${"true"}" tabindex="${"-1"}" href="${"#the-message-youre-sending"}"><span class="${"icon icon-link"}"></span></a>The Message You\u2019re Sending</h2>
<p>Even\xA0if you were able to immediately and completely process a new design at first glance and be ready to write a comprehensive\xA0blog post about it on first impression\xA0(and just to reiterate, you can\u2019t. But even if you could), there\u2019s still a good reason why you shouldn\u2019t.</p>
<p>If you\u2019re a designer, you undoubtedly tell your clients the same thing you were told as a design student, namely: no matter how simple the end product, design is\xA0hard work, and aesthetics aren\u2019t\xA0the whole point. To come up with something that <em>looks</em> good, something somebody\xA0<em>likes</em>, is at best tangential to the main point. We\u2019ve all chanted the mantra a thousand times: design is about more than appearances. It\u2019s about problem solving and communication. And problem solving and communication generally require days, weeks or maybe even months of intensive research, ideation, brainstorming, creation and revision.</p>
<p>Whether the result of real problem-solving\xA0design\xA0work is something anybody\xA0<em>likes</em> is beside the point. The question is, does it succeed at meeting the project goals? Does it <em>solve</em> the problem?</p>
<p>And you don\u2019t know the answer to that question.</p>
${(0, import_index_2749e1b7.v)(import_PullQuote_effacfdf.P, "PullQuote").$$render($$result, {}, {}, {

`;
    }
  })}
<p>You didn\u2019t see the brief. You weren\u2019t there for the meetings. Odds are that you have only a casual\xA0knowledge of the client in question.\xA0You didn\u2019t see all the ideas that were pitched and you weren\u2019t part of the discussion on why some failed and others succeeded. You didn\u2019t weigh the advantages and disadvantages of this color or that font. You didn\u2019t present the final iterations, you didn\u2019t hear the client\u2019s feedback, and you didn\u2019t have to find a way to merge each and every last one of\xA0those\xA0requirements and limitations into a single, cohesive entity.</p>
<p>That gives you absolutely no right to critique anything except the subjective aesthetics of the design you\u2019re seeing.</p>

`;
    }
  })}
<p>And I\u2019m willing to bet money that you\xA0<em>hate it</em> when somebody does that to your design.</p>
<p>\u201CWell, sure I wanted to change this, but the brief required\u2026\u201D</p>
<p>\u201CYeah, I would have liked to explore typefaces more, but the budget\u2026\u201D</p>
<p>\u201CThis color definitely wasn\u2019t my first choice, but according to our audience research\u2026\u201D</p>

<p>These are all sentences you can\u2019t hear because\xA0you get the luxury of seeing the final product without any knowledge whatsoever of how it came into existence. Remake somebody else\u2019s\xA0logo design all you want, but\xA0know that it\u2019s utterly meaningless, because\xA0you get to do whatever you want and the original designer didn\u2019t. They had deadlines, budgets, parameters, meetings, goals, briefs, revisions, concerns and loads of client feedback. All you have\xA0is a starting point that somebody else already created for you and a social platform full of people willing to click the \u201Clike\u201D button.</p>
<p>Remaking\xA0somebody else\u2019s logo without knowledge of\xA0the full\xA0process behind it isn\u2019t design; it\u2019s practice at best, and doodling at worst.</p>

<p>Taking somebody else\u2019s work and toying with it is\xA0a fine exercise for somebody who\u2019s learning. But it\u2019s little more than\xA0plagiarism if you\u2019re telling\xA0an audience that\xA0this, in terms of real design, has any substantial meaning or value whatsoever.</p>
<p>When you show the world that you can supposedly take something existing and make it better in a single day, the message you\u2019re sending is, \u201Cdesign is effortless. It takes very little time, thought or energy. It\u2019s cheap, petty, subjective and\xA0shallow.\u201D You strip design\u2014and every other designer out there\u2014of their\xA0value and the respect that they deserve.</p>
<p>Don\u2019t do that. Don\u2019t cheapen what we do. Don\u2019t give the world the message that what we provide\xA0is easy, quick\xA0and mindless.</p>
<p>Design, at its best and as it ought to be, is absolutely none of those things.</p>`;
